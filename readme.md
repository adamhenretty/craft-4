This is an opinionated starter boilerplate for Craft CMS 4 + Tailwind-JIT and Vanilla JS via Laravel Mix 6. No JavaScript frameworks are included.

This branch does *not* use Tailwind's base styles (we're setting `preflight: false` in the Tailwind config), because we prefer to have at least _some_ base styling - instead we use our own CSS reset and base styles (see global.scss and elements.scss respectively).

Unlike many other boilerplates, this one prioritises simplicity. We don't want or need node/npm anywhere near our production server thank-you very much, and we don't want a complex deployment process, so builds are done locally on save (when running `npm run all`), and compiled files are committed to the repo and pushed to the remote. If for some reason you prefer a complicated deployment process and don't want to commit compiled files to your repo, you can run `npm run watch` and `npm run prod` separately for dev/production builds, and gitignore the public `assets` directory.

As a minimum, though, your deployment process will need to run `composer install && ./craft migrate/all` if `composer.lock` has changed, and `composer install && ./craft project-config/apply` if `config/project/project.yaml` has changed. Depending on how you write your templates, you might also want to clear Craft's template caches. (We tend to prefer full page static caching, which makes using Craft's `{% cache %}` tags redundant).

To use this Craft boilerplate:
====================================

1. Be sure that your CLI is running at least PHP 8.1, then run `composer install`
1. Create a new local blank database and local virtual host
1. Update your control panel trigger word in `config/general.php` to something unique
1. Create your local `.env` file from the sample and populate with all relevant details
1. Run `./craft setup/app-id && ./craft setup/security-key` to recreate a new app ID and security key (copy these values to the remote env files manually later)
1. Install Craft by visiting the control panel and following the on-screen instructions. Keep the site name as $PRIMARY_SITE_URL so it will pull from .env
1. Create an entry in the Home Pages section
1. Update `package.json` with project name
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run all` or `npm run prod` or `npm run watch` to start work at http://localhost:3000

The `npm run all` task is configured to do both dev and production builds locally on save, so no need for separate dev/prod build processes here. If running both at the same time ever becomes too taxing on your CPU, you can run them separately with `npm run prod` and `npm run watch`.

The included functionality is relatively barebones, however there are some things that we find ourselves using on every project and they are therefore included here:

JS functionality
-------------------

This repo includes the following JS libraries:

* <a href="https://github.com/willmcpo/body-scroll-lock">BodyScrollLock</a> by @willmcpo
* <a href="https://codepen.io/croxton/pen/yLOLzjo">Toggle</a> by @croxton

Example code for using the accessible toggle functionality (set this as an auto-expand snippet/live template in your editor):

```
<button type="button"
	class="button-reset js-toggleAThing"
	aria-controls="js-idOfThingToToggle"
	data-active-target-id="js-idOfThingToToggle"
	data-active-target="is-active"
	data-active="is-active"
	aria-expanded="false"
>
	Toggle Text
</button>

<div id="js-idOfThingToToggle" aria-hidden="true" class="hidden">
	<button type="button" data-close>Close me</button>
	toggle me
</div>

Now put this into your bindUI function in main.js:
new Toggle('.js-toggleAThing');
(best to use a new instantiation for each type of toggler so that they don't interfere with each other)
```

If you want to transition-in the hidden thing instead of an instant show/hide, just use a transform class like `class="translate-x-full"` instead of `hidden`. (The `.is-active` modifier will remove all transforms, set opacity to 1 and enable pointer events (see utilities.scss)).

CSS functionality
-------------------

* A custom made SCSS `fluid` mixin for fluid values between two breakpoints. Useful for font-sizes and also vertical padding.

Craft plugins
----------------

This repo includes the following Craft plugins:

* <a href="https://plugins.craftcms.com/mix">Mix (fork for Craft 4)</a>
* <a href="https://plugins.craftcms.com/minify">Minify</a>
* <a href="https://plugins.craftcms.com/cp-field-inspect">CP Field Inspect</a>
